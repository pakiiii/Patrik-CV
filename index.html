        <h1>Patrik Ibraim</h1>
        <!-- <h2>Necu tu nista stavljati</h2>-->
        <p>I graduated from the University of Applied Sciences Velika Gorica, majoring in Computer Systems Maintenance, and through student internships and employment, I gained practical experience in system administration and server maintenance. I am passionate about optimizing IT systems and solving technical challenges.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>During my vocational high school training, I had the opportunity to complete practical work, gaining experience in basic electrical installations, including mounting outlets, switches, and lighting.
            I also assisted with cable routing, small panel connections, as well as simple diagnostics and replacements.
            I chose to pursue a career in IT because I have been working with computers for over 18 years.
            I completed my university studies in a field that aligns with my career goals, while remaining open to exploring different areas within the IT sector.
            I am versatile, motivated, and genuinely interested in all aspects of IT.
            Most of my hands-on experience comes from system administration, and I have developed strong teamwork skills, consistently achieving excellent results with my colleagues. I am currently seeking a company where I can combine my existing knowledge with continuous professional development.
            I believe your firm provides an environment where learning never stops, and where I could further expand my skills. I also hope that my experience so far will allow me to contribute meaningfully to the team.
